# Sartre

> A curated publication for technical write-ups, guides, and tutorials.

---

## Vision

**Sartre** is a personal publication platform that blends the **depth and authority of a technical blog** with the **visual density and utility of Hacker News**.

It's not a community forum where anyone can post. It's a **curated anthology**—a collection of high-quality, long-form essays on reverse engineering, systems programming, and software development.

### The Ideal

Think of it as:

- **Your own personal "Papers We Love"**: A dense, numbered index of essays you've written.
- **An RFC archive, but for your thoughts**: Clean, spec-document aesthetics. Monospaced headers. Warm paper tones.
- **Bear Blog meets Hacker News**: Minimalist reading experience, maximum information density on the index.

### What It Is

| Aspect       | Philosophy                                           |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content**  | Long-form. Researched. Tutorials, deep-dives, notes. |
| **Audience** | Developers, reverse engineers, curious builders.     |
| **Tone**     | Technical but approachable. Opinionated.             |
| **Quality**  | Curated, not crowdsourced. Fewer posts, higher bar.  |

### What It Isn't

- ❌ A multi-user forum (no arbitrary signups, no comment sections).
- ❌ A micro-blogging platform (no short-form hot takes).
- ❌ A portfolio site (no "about me" hero sections).

## Core Features

1.  **The Feed**: A Hacker News-style numbered list of posts. Dense metadata (date, reading time, tags). Fast to scan.
2.  **The Reader**: A distraction-free reading view optimized for long-form technical content. Beautiful typography, syntax-highlighted code blocks.
3.  **The Archive**: Browse by tag, series, or date. Find everything.

## Name

**Sartre**: The philosopher. Existentialism. "Existence precedes essence."

The name implies that **the writing defines the site**, not the other way around. The platform is a vessel for the content, not the point of the content.
